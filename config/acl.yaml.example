StaticAcl:
    # mapping from "pool" to user IDs
    # below only user "me" can access the pool with ID "default" if "enableAcl" 
    # is set to true in pools.yaml
    default: [me]

RemoteAcl:
    # the request URL will be appended with the user ID, e.g. in the example 
    # below that would be: https://example.org/groups/me
    apiBaseUrl: https://example.org/groups

VootAcl:
    # uses the VOOT protocol to obtain group memberships, it will use the 
    # UserConfig access_token to perform the request, if no access_token is set
    # or it is invalid, an empty list of groups will be returned
    apiBaseUrl: https://voot.surfconext.nl/groups

    # A mapping between pool IDs and groups obtained through VOOT API
